# ts-dom-libs

Generic utilities frontend that I use in different projects, written in *typescript*.

## Install

To add the library to your project:

```bash
$ npm install https://github.com/rnascunha/ts-dom-libs.git
```

## Build

If you want to build yourself, clone the repository and compile it:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/rnascunha/ts-dom-libs.git
$ npm install
$ npx tsc --build
```
All the output files will be avaiable at the `dist` directory.
